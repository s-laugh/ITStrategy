Making change happen in large organizations is a seemingly insurmountable task and on your own, it is. One must remember that no matter how many books one has, and no matter how confident on is that they have the magic sauce needed to fix a department, you work among thousands of other people, many of which likely feel the exact same as you. To make matters worse, many of your fellow passionate change agent colleagues may be pushing in another direction, equally confident in their approach. So how does one do it?

How does one become the catalyst for change? Does it begin with a new policy or directive, a really compelling blog post (I certainly hope so), or perhaps the right member of the management team? The cheap answer is always "all of the above" and each of these does play a part. However, with few exceptions, or perhaps none, nobody has the power to force entire organizations to accept change. One must also consider that different tools are effective at different levels. For example, a policy or a directive may promote an appetite for change at senior levels though is likely to sway  the working level who just wants to get the job done, with or without lengthy documents written in cryptic vagueness suggesting they align with "an IM-IT strategic plan to a Digital Operations Strategic Plan supports this ideal, and acknowledges the need for greater integration in government to deliver on this digital vision, including across functional communities and within teams." Having worked on strategy and closely with senior management for a short time now, sometimes we do not realize strategies or recommendations we write would appear vague as to us they are crystal clear. It is this exact difference of perspective that creates a void that is hard to cross. It is this exact same void that can make it difficult for management to enact change at the working level. A policy may be meaningful for senior management, but you're going to have to sell the value of said policy or directive to the working level -- at least this is the reality within a Canadian government organization. Even if a senior manager is sold by a policy the end goal is still to get the working level folk to modify the way they work, and the tools they work with, the align with said initiative. It is fair to conclude then that change is bound with ones ability to change how people work, which is only losely related to some high falootin policy passed by some executive in a central agency. So whether you are a senior manager trying to enact change, or a change agent trying to promote change within the organization, how does one get said change to manifest in the organization?

In the DevOps Handbook they suggest, "[TO-DO: Quote about how to start the DevOps transformation]". Sounds easy enough. In typical Lean/Agile/DevOps fashion the solution is to start small and scale. When the IT Strategy team was first formed that sounded easy enough. We'll write some wicked awesome documents, senior management will sign off, we'll give these devine documents to those doing the work, and bam, DevOps transformation complete. Unfortunately, the story never unfolds like this. Firstly, getting sign off in government organizations is like pulling teeth, if one grew teeth as quickly as they could be pulled out, creating and endless cycle of consistent pain with little to no sign of progress. Another article shall be written on the peculiar state the government has found itself in, where accountability is often discussed yet simultaneously diluted to the point of irrelevancy. One writes a document, which need be reviewed by someone, before it can be reviewed by someone more senior, to be reviewed by a committee, before going to the final committee. Along the way, everyone asks that everyone else between here and Mount Doom be consulted, and if the document ever does make it to the "final committee" (whose definition differs depending who you ask), it's likely years after the trend you were trying to promote has gone out of style and so watered down so as to be unrecognizable. For the time being, we only intend to highlight that 'getting senior management buy-in' is neigh impossible, which was the initial step required in our simple initial DevOps transformation dream.

That's alright -- few things easy are worth doing. Plan of attack #2 -- quick wins. We shall identify processes that are especially slow and attempt to increase their effeciency. Even if it's not in my team specifically, one can find a process that commonly prevents their team from delivering as quickly as they could. Everyone has heard the phrasing 'breaking down silos' echoing throughout their organization, and that is a logically way of breaking out of my silos and identifying quick wins. Step one then becomes identifying which processes are the slowest. To begin, one should find metrics. Upon further inspection, one realizes that when they inquire about metrics they are met with statements akin to, "um, these data are not maintained so they may be a little out of date", or, "we don't collect metrics, we asked for a tool to help us though have no time to procure the tool or configure it". Ignoring this common justification which DevOps attempts to address, one must eventually relent and modify their approach. If one does not have metrics to identify the (constraints)[https://www.itchronicles.com/dev-ops/theory-of-constraints-devops/] or bottlenecks in the (value stream)[https://itrevolution.com/improve-flow-devops-value-stream/] that's alright, from conversations with colleagues one could just pick some process which is known to be slow by its users.

Then with all the best intentions one sends e-mails to the respective owners of said process you are looking to help with. Inevitably, you will find a host of hard working folk struggling to keep their heads above water as waves upon waves of requests flood their group mailbox. After sending various meeting requests that get postponed time and time again, you eventually meet with said process owner, or owners. One will likely quickly realize that 'the process' is a hodgepodge of mixed accountabilities, various committees (or as Marc Swartz refers to them in War & Peace & IT, Star Chambers), and an establish methodology that the team swears by and was leveraged to create said process. After quoting your favourite podcasts and books on why you know the One True Way, the team suggests you send a follow up e-mail and you could discuss further when the team has the cycles, otherwise to be interpreted as upon the heat death of the universe.

In conclusion, you have tried

1. Getting sign off from senior management
2. Identifying bottlenecks or constraints in the value stream
3. Attempt to improve an existing process

What now? This entire process is one the team has seem time and time again throughout various departments within the Government of Canada. Policies are a good start, though anyone who has read one and attempted to enforce it in the department knows much more is needed. But what can one do? The answer is not to bring change to the organization, but rather to enable it.

In all likelihood whatever awesome new ideas you are attempting to push on the organization is already being pushed by fellow travellers in the organization. You're not the only one who listens to those podcasts and reads those same books. 

# Step 0: Get out of your bubble! 
Find those working tangentially to you. How does one do this? Get out of your bubble! Make an account on GCConnex, GCCollab, GC Messenger (TO-DO: links), or join one of the Government of Canada committees such as the GC DevOps League or the Agora Open Source committee, or get on Twitter and start following change agents from various departments. You will find there are many change agents floating around the Government of Canada. Chances are there are many of them who work in the same organization as you. I call this step zero as it will help with future steps, though on it's own does not enact change, and that is what we are looking to do. Enact change, not just talk about it. 

# Step 1: Learn the current process
Even if the current process has it's flaws it was likely put in place with signficant time allocated, a framework behind it, and hard work to integrate it into the organization and document it for approval. The least compelling arguement to change something is accompanied with ignorence of the current process or a lack of appreciation of the work that went, and goes into, it. DevOps teaches us that in order to create a fast and responsive organization in a modern organization automation is essential. It may even be the case that the process need not be changed, perhaps there are a few labour intensive steps that could be automated and result in significant gains.

# Step 2: Learn from those whom your change will effect

# Step 3: Enable change
Be the change you want to see. If you think a given process is too slow and the folks within said team (or perhaps your own team) don't want to change it, *demonstrate* how it can be improved -- don't just complain it's too slow. Everyone is doing the best they can within the circumstances they find themselves in. Take your solution as far as you can. For example, depending on your skillset 

- Educate yourself as to existing frameworks and methodologies to solve the same problem
- Define a new process
- Find or create a tool to demonstrate the value and efficacy of the new way of doing things
- Host said tool (ensuring there is no protected information)
  - If you have not used your free credits on (AWS)[https://aws.amazon.com/] or (Azure)[https://azure.microsoft.com/] that's a great place to start

# Step 4: Implement change
Start small ... need to finish article, but need to study :)
